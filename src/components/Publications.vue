Paper-based system is still the spine of this system which is tedious, less accurate and difficult to store and update. So, there is a need for a digitized system providing countryâ€™s land authorities with a powerful tool that creates a unified platform for the creation of an accurate spatial database, timely maintenance and updating of the database in a dynamic web platform. The database including spatial data of land features can be utilized to create a web-based thin-client mapping application which meets the needs of all the stakeholders (government authorities from Survey Offices, Land Revenue Offices, Land Reform Offices, etc.).'},
